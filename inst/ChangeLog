changes in version 1.5.1 (2010-4-23)

  * removed the wgs dataset.  The lproks table again reports release dates
  for assembly genomes (no release dates were added between 9/15.09 and 
  4/15/10) 

changes in version 1.4.0 (2010-4-13)

	* fixed the main url (eutils.ncbi.. not www.ncbi) and added tool and 
  email options to E-utility scripts (now required by NCBI).

	* added details to genomes-update about reporting counts of new
	IDs added and old IDs removed.   

changes in version 1.3.1 (2010-4-11)

	* added print.genomes method to print the first few rows and
	columns of a genome table (also reordered the included datasets so
	id, name, status, and released is in first 4 columns)

	* improved messages for updating genomes.  Now the number of new
	project ids added AND old projects ids removed is reported

	* modified package to import XML package (no longer depends on
	XML)

	* added subset.genomes and [.genomes to extract parts of a genome
	table (and preserve some genome class attributes and not others)

	* added latin2char function to replace a few latin characters in
	NCBI tables with ASCII. Now R CMD check runs without the "Portable
	packages use only ASCII characters in their datasets" warning

	* added new summary methods for tables without status column
